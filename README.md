## Intro
This is one of the first apps that I built while working through the _AP Computer Science Principles with Swift_ book written by Apple Inc. 
You can find the book [here](https://books.apple.com/us/book/ap-computer-science-principles-with-swift/id1456795905). However, you can only download and read it if 
you have an Apple device. 
The book is simply the AP course but in the Swift language and Xcode. 
I went through this book over the summer before my freshman fall courses at UCR as
a way to prepare and review for future CS classes, and to prepare me for the next book I planned to read, [App Development With Swift](https://books.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996).      

## MemeMaker
In this app, I was introduced to:      
- Arrays in Swift   
- Classes in Swift   
- Segmented Controls    
- Updating/Changing values in Segmented Controls

The app displays a segmented control at the top and bottom of the screen, and a predetermined image in the center of the screen. 
At the top and bottom of the image, there are two text labels that display text. 
By selecting different titles of the segmented control, you change the text that is displayed at the top and bottom of the image.
